# Benchmarking Vision Transformers (ViT) vs. CNNs on Medical Imaging

## Introduction
This project benchmarks the performance of Vision Transformers (ViT) against standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for **Pneumonia Detection** on Chest X-Ray images. The goal is to investigate architectural differences, data efficiency, and the impact of augmentations in a medical context.Course 046211 Project

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YahavFrei/ViT-vs-CNN-medical-imaging.git](https://github.com/YahavFrei/ViT-vs-CNN-medical-imaging.git)
   cd ViT-vs-CNN-medical-imaging
2. Create the environment and install dependencies:
    conda create --name dl-project python=3.9 -y
    conda activate dl-project
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
    We use the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. Data setup instructions will be added here.

## Usage
    Instructions for training the models and reproducing the results will be provided once the implementation is complete.
